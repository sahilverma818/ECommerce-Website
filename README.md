>>> ***Project Description***

    1.) Frontend Portion ::->

        Starts with LOGIN & REGISTRATION PAGE. You can't go ahead without login. After login it redirected the user to the HOME PAGE. Where you can select your required products and add them to cart.


    2.) Backend Portion ::-> 
        The project was built on Django (MVC model), Django REST Framework & JWT Token

        The first breakpoint for a ecommerce website is user authentication & login. So, we register and store information of registered user in django auth_user (Bydefault table for storing user). If the user is registered and tries to login then Bearer Token is generated through JWT Token. This bearer token has an expiry of a set timing so, by this we implemented session login.

        Later on, we created views for CRUD Operation using Django REST Framework. To transfer data in JSON format, we use django serializer.

        Throughout the project a good pipeline established to take the commanding url in a flow. We implemented HTTP request ('GET','POST','PATCH','PUT','DELETE'). Handles CSRF Token.

        We created function based view, python decorators, python modules throughout this work. Tried to implement all known term that might be useful in this project.


>>> ***Most important***
                                    *** Thanks to our mentors ***

                Because this is a project which not only taught us the technical facts but also how a big project goes through many small works that are integrated throughout its end.
                
                A project that takes us to a big journey of many small steps.

                So, Thanks a lot to our mentor  



>>> ***Some words***

        Its a project which taught us not just how to implement all the learned facts but more than that how to explore the world to expand our skill set. Like, taking help not just to complete but to upgrade ourself. Everything is a learning.
